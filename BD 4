Aim: Implement an application that stores big data in Hbase / MongoDB and manipulate it using R / Python.


Hardware / Software Required: Windows 10, MongoDB, Jupyter Notebook 
Install MongoDB Community Edition:

1. Download the installer. 
● Download the MongoDB Community .msi installer from the following link: - https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
● In the Platform dropdown, select Windows. 
● In the Package dropdown, select msi. 
● Click Download. 

 
2. Run the MongoDB installer. 
● For example, from the Windows Explorer/File Explorer: 
  Go to the directory where you downloaded the MongoDB installer (.msi file). 
● By default, this is your Downloads directory. 
● Double-click the .msi file.

3. Follow the MongoDB Community Edition installation wizard. 
● Choose Setup Type as complete

4. Select Install MongoD as a Service MongoDB as a service. 
● Run the service as Network Service user (Default)

5. Select Install MongoDB Compass (Default) given in bottom left corner tick the box;
 Just finalize the installation.

6. Launch MongoDB: Once the installation is complete, you can start MongoDB using the mongod command in the command prompt
● And after launching it create new connection as given below;
● Click Save & Connect
●	Create a new database:  By clicking “ + Create database ” 
●	Add a database and collection name and remember it for further process

		
Installing Jupyter Notebook using pip:

1.	Jupyter: Command to install Jupyter: 
●	python -m pip install jupyter 
2.After finishing Installation run the given below command to just simply open the jupyter notebook:
● Jupyter notebook 
3.Make a new notebook in the jupyter notebook and run this code given below:

code:
# importing module
from pymongo import MongoClient

# creation of MongoClient
client = MongoClient()

# connect with the portnumber and host
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")

# Access database
mydatabase = client["BC_G"]

# Access collection of the database
mycollection = mydatabase["big_data"]

# dictionary to be added in the database
rec = {
    "title": "MongoDB and Python",
    "description": "MongoDB is no SQL database",
    "tags": ["mongodb", "database", "NoSQL"],
    "viewers": 300
}

# inserting the data in the database
mycollection.insert_one(rec)

[Note: Make sure that you change the database and collection name as per your given code and localhost of the mongodb compass]

● Click download to download the python file 

Final Procedure:

1.	Open the Mongodb compass and go to your collection folder and just import the data or that python file we just downloaded from jupyter notebook by clicking on “ Import Data ”.
2.	Show the result displayed on the MongoDB:
