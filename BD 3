Aim: Exploring Hadoop Distributed File System


Listing Contents of a Directory:
This command lists the contents of the specified HDFS directory.
hdfs dfs -ls /path/to/directory

Creating a Directory:
Use this command to create a new directory in HDFS.
hdfs dfs -mkdir /path/to/new_directory

Copying Local Files to HDFS:
Copies files from the local file system to HDFS.
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal /local/path /hdfs/path

Copying Files from HDFS to the Local File System:
Retrieves files from HDFS and copies them to the local file system.
hdfs dfs -copyToLocal /hdfs/path /local/path

Uploading a Local File to HDFS:
Similar to the copyFromLocal command, this uploads a local file to HDFS.
hdfs dfs -put /local/path/file.txt /hdfs/path

Downloading a File from HDFS to Local File System:
Retrieves a file from HDFS and copies it to the local file system.
hdfs dfs -get /hdfs/path/file.txt /local/path

Viewing the Contents of a File:
Displays the content of a file stored in HDFS.
hdfs dfs -cat /hdfs/path/file.txt

Moving a File or Directory within HDFS:
Moves a file or directory from one location to another within HDFS.
hdfs dfs -mv /source/path /destination/path

Removing a File or Directory:
Deletes a file or an empty directory from HDFS.
hdfs dfs -rm /hdfs/path/file.txt
hdfs dfs -rmdir /hdfs/path/directory

Checking Disk Usage:
Displays the disk usage of a specified HDFS directory.
hdfs dfs -du -h /hdfs/path
